I actually ran into a similar problem where a change I needed to make resulted in an "Undocumented Error/Invalid RDL Structure" error in 2016, so I edited the RDL file so I could open it in an earlier version and make my changes. Not too hard, but you need to make a couple of tag edits.

For new reports you should probably just use an older version, but for existing reports you can do this: (I reverted to 2008)

Change the Report tag:
Remove MustUnderstand="df"
Change the xmlns value to "http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/reporting/2008/01/reportdefinition"
Delete the xmlns:df attribute.
Delete the entire "ReportParametersLayout" block.
Delete the "df" tag and its content.
Delete the "ReportSections" and "ReportSection" opening and closing tags (not the content).
Actually wrote some superhackish code to do this as part of a blog post, but the manual edit is simple enough.
