Hi! You've just downloaded our free SQL Server health check, sp_Blitz.

Run sp_Blitz.sql in SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio. It will
generate a prioritized list of things to review - missing backups, failed 
corruption checks, performance issues, and so forth.

Priorities 1-50 are things you should focus on right away. We say these are the
reasons folks lose their jobs.

Priorities 51 & higher are progressively less urgent - things you want to be
aware of, but just fix at more convenient times.

If you have questions, you can get free support here:

If you want to build a health check report for your users and you need a sample
template, check out the two PDFs in the zip file too. These are samples from
our SQL Critical Care process. You can learn more about that here:

Thanks, and we hope we helped make your job suck just a little less.
